# dwolla-rs

Rust bindings for the Dwolla (Balance) API.

As of now, you can only call endpoints that are in the examples. This was partly autogenerated with Progenitor. The OpenAPI specification used was out of date, as the newer versions used a split OpenAPI3 specification, unsupported by many generators. Many endpoints are very close to being supported (vast majority responses are reasonably up to date and respective endpoints just need to parse these responses).

Feel free to open up issues on endpoints you would like support for and reach out if you would like to help maintain this crate.
